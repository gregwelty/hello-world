# hello-world
A place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

(OK, I stole that line from the tutorial.)

I'm a philosopher, and I teach philosophy full-time, but I'm nostalgic about programming, having taught myself (in chronological order):

	Z80 assembly
	6502 assembly
	BASIC
	Pascal
	HTML
	Perl
	Javascript
  Python
  
So, Python is my current area of interest.
